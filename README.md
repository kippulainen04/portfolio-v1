## üöÄ Overview

This is a basic version of my portfolio, including all projects that I have done for the **freeCodeCamp* - **Responsive Web Design**.

In this repository, I got inspired by the idea of making a flip-card effect and some transformation effect by using mainly two languages, 
as **[HyperText Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#:~:text=The%20HyperText%20Markup%20Language%20or,(HyperText%20Markup%20Language)) 
and [Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)**

## üßë‚Äçüíª Learning Objectives

After fulfilling the project, I accquire knowledge to:
* Build and style static webpages with semantic **HTML** and **CSS**
* Implement best practices and standards when structuring HTML files using nested elements, indentation, comments, and line breaks
* Implement the use of adding **Images & Links** into HTML, using **`<li>, <section>, so on`tags** to present the content of the project
* Implement CSS styling via class, id and element selectors using external stylesheets and inline styles, as well as CSS GRID
* Implement **Bootstrap** styling, **Google font**, **Font Awesome**, **CSS breakpoints** and **Navigation** with **Responsive web design** theory
* Use **Git workflow** to initialize projects, track changes, and host via remote server
* Execute live deployment using **GitHub** Pages
